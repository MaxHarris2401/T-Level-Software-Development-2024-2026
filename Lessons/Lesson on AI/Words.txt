The island is roughly five miles long and three miles wide. If you climb to the top of Skull Mountain and look out, you will see that it has the shape of a fish. It looks like a dolphin lying on its side, with its tail pointing to the east (sunrise) and its nose pointing to the west (sunset). There are also several large jagged cliffs that extend into the sea and resemble fins. These features explain why people call it Dolphin Island.

The entire island is cloaked with thick green vegetation that runs all the way down to the shore. A beach of white, velvety sand covers the entire perimeter, lined with shrubbery and coconut trees. Skull Mountain truly does look like a skull, with two huge dark holes for eyes that form a cave where bats and other creatures sleep by day. At night, they come out in search of food, but finding a good meal on such a small island can sometimes be difficult.
