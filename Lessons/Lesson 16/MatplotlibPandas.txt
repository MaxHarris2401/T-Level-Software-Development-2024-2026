Pandas is a data science library, external of python and therefore needs to be manually installed.
Matplotlib is a very powerful library, but is very complicated to use so we can use pandas to interract with it.
Pandas:
    - Living in a data frame object, they work like 2d arrays, where columns are named and statistical functions can be applied.
    - Good for data analysis and manipulation
    - Good for handling sets of data
    - Handling missing data
    - Time series data
Accessing data from a dataframe
    - .loc is for selecting data from a dataframe, you can get a single or an array of labels
    - df.loc['room'] or df.loc['room','region']
    - .iloc is used for selecting data via an integer
    - Df.iloc[0] or df.iloc[[1,2,4]]
- Pandas.concat is used to add two dataframes together which can be used to join like in SQL
- Dataframe.dropna(inplace=True) removes values that are missing
    - Inplace means that it alters the dataframe rather than requiring a new one e.g dataframe2 = dataframe.dropna()
- Dataframe.mean() returns the mean values over the request axis
- To access one column
- Dataframe['column_name']
- value_counts() is a groupby, will count how many of each thing exist in a series/column
