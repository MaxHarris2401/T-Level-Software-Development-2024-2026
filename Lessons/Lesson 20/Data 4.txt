Data assurance
- Data that is gathered, processed and analysed must have a high level of reliability and quality
- Unreliable or low-quality data is bad data
- The reliability of data refers to how accurate and complete it is
- To increase quality of data, verification and validation techniques can be used.
Data redundancy
- Is when you've stored the same piece of data two or more times on a digital system
- Can be linked with data inconsistency
- Including when it is stored in multiple different formats or data types
- Or storing data acreoss multiple locations, an issue when only one location gets updated
- Could lead to results of processing and analysis providing unreliable or meaningless information
- Which can lead to incorrect decisions being made at strategic and tactical levels
- If done properly data redundancy can be a back-up copy of your data
Qualitative and quantitative
- Data gathered using survey and questionaires
- These may follow as feedback from an interaction witha customer
Research population
- Research population is the number of people required to complete the search
- Organisations will select a research population it will use to gather the required data and information
- How many people selected will depend on the defined requirements needed from the results of the research.
- Whenh selecting a research pop, its important to consider the demographhics selected as they must related to the pre-defined requirement
- If your research population is skewed in for example age or gender, the results of the research might not be relightable or high-quality data
Legislation and regulatory requirements
- When data is being gathered it must comply with up-to-date legislation and any relevant regulations
- Including the data protection act need to be considered
- This should all be done with acountability and fairness inline with these legislations
Organisational factors
- Three main factors:
- Time
- Skills 
- Cost
- Gathering data takes time, both with internal and external sources, including from a data warehouse or lakes. There will be financial impact in terms of how long it takes
to get the data.
- Data entry takes skill, time & money
- Data must be maintained, checking the data is kept up to date, if the data relates to personal data it is a legal requirement to be kept up to date, it could have also became
redundannt over time. This takes skill time and money.
- As the amount of data increases, so does your storage needs. Be that onsite or cloud, this increases costs, either as a one-off opayment or ongoing contractual payments,
this will also require staff to be trained to handle data.
- These tasks could all be done by a 3rd party, but that would increase financial costs and could cause significant impact if the requirements aren't clearly defined
