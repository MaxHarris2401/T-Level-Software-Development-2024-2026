Data Warehousing
- Is a central collection of key data, integrated into a pre-defined format
- Allow data to be used for business-critica evidence-based decisions
- Data used to fill the data warehouse will likely be from a range of sources, external & internal
- Meaning it will be in a variety of formats and will need to be subjected to data cleaning. This process will involve converting data.
- Once we put data into a data warehouse it cannot change or be edited
- Data can be added, as sources are updated
- Decisions need to be made on what data is included or excluded form the DW
- Data is only put into the DW if a use has already been identified
    - A DW can be used to process and analyse data on previous data, rather than currently in use data
    - DW's are used by specific businesses users to analyse and extract particular meaning from the data that was defined when the DW is setup
    - Analysis of data in a DW usually focuses on changes in data in a given time period, for example analysing sales in the previous year
    - Data in a DW must be secure, reliable, easy to retrieve and easy to manage - for Analysis
    - A DW could be physical devices or in a secure cloud
Data cleaning
- The process of going through data and looking for errors, correcting them or excluding data where errors have been located
Data Lakes
- DLs are data stores that hold data in an unstructured way.
- UNLIKE a DW, there si no defined format to the way data is structured; data is stored in a raw state as it may not be processed
- This data is only ever converted to a predefined format when it is ready to be used and analysed.
- It is possible some data in a DL will never be used
- That can be due to it containing all data over time in a raw state
- One benefit is that because there is so much data held there, the range of analysis and processing that can be done is large
Data mining 
- Data mining is used by org's to process and analyse raw data
- Software is used to look for trends and patterns in big data sources such as data warehouses or lakes
Data reporting
- Takes data and converts it to information
- It can show what an org is happening now, rather than analysis which only shows why something is happening
Metadata
- Data about data
- Metatdata can be clasified in 3 main ways
- Administrative
    - Provides Administrative instructions about a file
    - Including details on any restrictions to be placed on the file
- Descriptive
    - Relate to how data could be identified
    - Including titles, dates or keywords
- Structural
    - Describes how the digital asset is arranged or structured
    - For example a data dictionary
- Basically all files or interactins with a digital system will either include or generate metadata
