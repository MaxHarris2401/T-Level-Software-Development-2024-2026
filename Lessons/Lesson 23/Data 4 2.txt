Data access
- We all know that data is the most valuable asset of a business
- We don't want everyone to be able to access this, the janitor doesnt need access after all
- Permissions can be set to limit who can access
- Rules can also be set, which can be part of permissions to attempt to increase data security
- These rules could be things like access to all files and access to specific files and folders
- Likely to be based on job role in org's
Unauthorised data access
- The impacts of the loss or unauthorised editing of data can include
- Data bias
- Inaccurate data leading to incorrect processing analysis and uninformed decisions being made
- A data breach/leak leading to possible legal or financial impact
Role & use of APIs in managing data access
- Application Programming Interface (API)
- Enables users to manage access and use data across a range of platforms
- API advantage - user's dont need to create accounts for multiple websites
- APIs
    - Allow applications to access data and interact with other applications or systems by sending and recieving requests
    - To send and recieve requests API's use JSON (usually)
    - API sends a user request to a digitals system, the digital system will send a response back to the user
    - APIs ensure authorised users can access and manage data, but must be maintained to ensure security
    - Meaning the certification should be set to the level appropriate to the data
    - PI certification should be set to partner or private NOT public certification
    - Advantages
        - API enables authorised users to access data even when the business makes changes to the backend system for example the DBMS
        - As long as the basic structure and function doesn't change the API will remain functional
        - APIs most commonly used by the financial services sector, Customer Relations Management systems and online retailers
Data at rest: data that has reached a destination and is not being accessed or used
Data in motion: When data is moving from one location to another, more susceptible to security attacks
Data in use: data that's actively being used and/or processed by a user or digital system
