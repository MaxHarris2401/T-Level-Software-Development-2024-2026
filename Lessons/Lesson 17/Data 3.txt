Data Wrangling
    - The process of taking unorganised raw data an processing it into standardised data to be analysed
    - Meaning it'll be structured to meet the needs of the organisation.
6 steps of data Wrangling
    - Discovery
    - Structure
    - Cleansing
    - Enrichment
    - Validation
    - Publishing
Explain two techniques that are used in data Wrangling
Cleansing - Cleansing data is hiding and removing errors, inconsistencies, and missing entries from data to increase the quality
Validation - Checking the accuracy and quality of the source data before using or processing data.

All blank data fields need to be consistently represented as empty

Core functions
    - All data systems have the same basic functions, how they are used will depend on the data being processed and the desired outcome
    - Our core functions of a data system are:
        - Input - for the collection of raw data
        - Search - Searches can be carried out on the data to meet the needs and requrirements of the organisation
        - Save - data that's been input into a system can be stored and then used again
        - Integrate - Different data types and formats can be integrated into a single location, and is used to build full and complete outputs that meet the requirements
        - Organise (Index) - Saved data can be organised and indexed, an index increases speed of searching data, as you wont have to search every record
        - Output - Data is processed and analysed. This is the output, which can then be sent to relevant people or places
Feedback loop
    - Feedback is output that is returned to, usually, senior management to help evaluate the process
    - For example, correct the tasks carried out at the input stage
Data entry & maintenance
    - All systems need data input to them at some point
    - Two main types of errors could be made on data entry
    - Transcription errors - Occur when copying the data from source document to data entry point, mostly from a user hitting the wrong key
    - Transposition errors - Occur when two letters or numbers have been reversed or swapped in order
Validation & Verification
    - To reduce the errors we need to use Validation and verification techniques
    - Verification
        - A check to see whether the data being entered into a digital system is identical to the source document or initial data entry
    - Validation
        - Checks that data being entered into a digital system is sensible and reasonable, and checks it against pre-set rules
        - Which can be used to prevent invalid data entries as only data that's within the rules can be entered meaning it must be
            - Sensible
            - Reasonable
            - Within the ruleset
            - Complete
        - When errors go against the validation rules are entered, there should be guidance to user on what is considered valid and how to correct their errors
        - Use of colours can increase clarity, green all entered correct
        - Red if an error is made
        - This is important as otherwise you'll be doing
            - Garbage in, Garbage out (GIGO)
        - Meaning you put bad data in you get bad data out
        - Most industries will enter data via a data entry screen
        - When these rules are created, they should be desinged with validation rules
Visualisation - Graphs
    - An area chart combines the line chart and bar chart to show how one or more groups' numeric values change over the progression of a second variable, 
    typically that of time. An area chart is distinguished from a line chart by the addition of shading between lines and a baseline, like in a bar chart.
    - A bar chart plots numeric values for levels of a categorical feature as bars. Levels are plotted on one chart axis, and values are plotted on the other axis. 
    Each value takes up one bar, and the length of each bar corresponds to the bar's value on the axis.
