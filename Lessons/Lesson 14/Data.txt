Data is raw, unprocessed data
Qualitative data:
    - Non-numerical data
    - e.g Opinions, interviews, written questions
Quantitative data
    - Numerical data
Information = data + structure + context + meaning
Information - structure
    - How information is presented
    - e.g dates, 24/04/2017 would have the structure NNNNNN (N meaning number)
    - or post codes which would be LLNN NLL (L meaning letter)
Information - context
    - The environment that we know to make sense of the data
    - 15, cabbages, rabbits
    - Means nothing until put into context
    - 15 cabbages were planted but all eaten by rabbits.
Information
    - The meaning ofdata is that it is in the correct structure and context
    - Information is in context, data can not be
    - Information is structured data which needs to be processed
Task
    - Knowledge is the ability to use information to form judgements and assessments
    - Information is data that has been processed with context and structure
    - Data is raw facts and figures that have not been processed
    - Example of Knowledge is wisdom
Why organisations need data and information
    - It is suggested that companies who do not understand the importance of data are less likely to survive in the modern era.
    - A company's data is it's most valuable asset.
    - To create a data-focused organisation, it is essential to understand everything about data management
Organisations use data to analyse market trends to identify patterns to inform decisions, analyse system performance, monitor users, 
use targeted marketing, and inform strategic tactical and operational decisions.
Market Analysis
    - Market analysis is a Quantitative and Qualitative assessment of a market for a business
    - It could look at the size of the market both for:
        - Volume
        - Value
    - Customer segmentation analysis, buying patterns, competition, and the economic environment in terms of barriers to entry and regulation could be included.
Metrics
    - A set of numbers that give information about a particular process or activity.
Dashboards
    - A type of GUI that provides visualisation of data related to performance indicator, usually accessible by a web browser with real-time data updates.
Human Generated Data
    - Data that is generated by humans using digital systems such as emails and social media posts
AI and Machine Learning
    - Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science of training machines to perform human tasks
        - For example speech interfaces like Alexas etc
    - Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI which teaches a device how to 'learn'
        - It looks for patterns in data to create conclusions "just like a real person would"
Sensors
    - Sensors measure a physical item and convert it into a digital signal
    - This signal is used to provide inputs to a digital system to provide data.
    - E.g a car's parking sensors will produce an audible output when its within a specific range of an object.
Internet of Things communications
    - Device to Device (D2D)
        - D2D connections accord when data is transferred between device over a network, for example
            - Alexa turning on a smart light bulb
    - Human to Device (H2D)
        - H2D usually happens using a GUI
            - With GUI
            - With voice
Transactional data
    - Data about transactions for an organisation
    - This can be created either between organisation and organisation or organisation and customer
    - For example, you buy and pay for an item online, your name, address and items you bought are examples of transactional data
    - This can be used to identify trends and patterns that occur in any interactions the organisations may have.
