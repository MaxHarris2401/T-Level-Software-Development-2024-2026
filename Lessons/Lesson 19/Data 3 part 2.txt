- Hierarchical database model shows the database steructure on a hierarchical structure. used to show the relationships between the tables, records and fields
- Relational data model shows a database as a collection of relationships. To show the relationships between the tables, records and fields using primary and foreign keys.
ERD
- ERD's can be used during the creation of conceptual, logical or physical data Models
- Three main parts of an ERD
- Entities - which will become the tables
- Columns - which describe the tables and are also called attributes will become fields in the Database
- Relationships - which are how the entities are linked
- Relationships can be, one to one, one to many, or many to many to show cardinality
- A completed ERD should not include any many to many
- If a M:M relationship exists a link entity needs to be created
